A Simple Workflow
Hereâ€™s how they fit together:

You start your day by running git pull to make sure your local main branch has the latest updates from the team.

You create a new branch, write some code, and push it to GitHub.

On the GitHub website, you open a Pull Request to ask for your new code to be merged into main.

Your team reviews your code, approves the Pull Request, and merges it.

Now the main branch on GitHub is updated. You switch back to your local main branch and run git pull again to get those newly merged changes.
